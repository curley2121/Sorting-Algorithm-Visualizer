# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is a simple project I built in Unity, using C#, after finishing my Algorithms course. I wanted to test my knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of the different types of sorting algorithms. I implemented two Divide and Conquer algorithms as well as three more simple sorting algorithms. You can learn more about the implemented algorithms below and access the application here: https://curley2121.github.io/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer/

Hope you enjoy!

## Instructions
Simply select an algorithm from the drop down menu in the top left corner and press the "Run Algorithm" button. Use the "Array Size" slider to adjust the number of elements in the array to be sorted. 

## Implemented Algorithms

**Merge Sort**: 
A very fast and efficient recursive Divide and Conquer algorithm that sorts an array in Θ(n log(n)) time.

**Selection Sort**: 
Repeatedly finds the minimum element and swaps it with the element directly following the sorted section of the array. Works in Θ(n^2) time complexity.

**Bubble Sort**: 
A very simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through the array swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order. Bubble Sort has a time complexity of Θ(n^2).

**Quick Sort**: 
A recursive Divide and Conquer algorithm, like Merge Sort, that works in Θ(n log(n)) time. More efficient than Merge Sort for smaller arrays.

**Insertion Sort**: 
A simple less efficient sorting algorithm that builds the array a single element at a time. Works in Θ(n^2) time.
